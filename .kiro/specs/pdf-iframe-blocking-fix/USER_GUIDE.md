## Getting Started

### Opening a Document

When you click on a document to view it, the PDF viewer will open in full-screen mode. The document will load automatically, and you'll see a progress indicator while it loads.

**What you'll see:**
- Document title at the top
- Navigation controls in the toolbar
- The PDF content in the main viewing area
- Zoom controls on the right side of the toolbar

### First-Time Loading

The first time you open a document, it may take a few seconds to load depending on:
- Your internet connection speed
- The size of the PDF file
- The number of pages in the document

**Tip:** Once loaded, pages are cached for faster viewing next time!

The PDF viewer supports two viewing modes:

#### Single Page Mode (Default)

### Pages Are Blank

**Problem:** The viewer loads but pages appear blank.

   - Look for a "Rendering..." message

2. **Try zooming:**

   - This clears the cache and starts fresh

### Slow Performance

   - Close unnecessary applications

2. **Use continuous scroll mode:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I download the PDF?

The download option depends on the document owner's settings. Some documents may have download restrictions for security reasons.

### Can I print the document?

Printing may be disabled for certain documents to protect sensitive information. If you need a printed copy, contact the document owner.

### Why can't I select text?

Text selection may be disabled for documents with DRM (Digital Rights Management) protections. This prevents unauthorized copying of content.

### How long does the document link last?

Document links typically expire after a certain time for security. If your link has expired, request a new one from the document owner.

### Can I view documents offline?

No, documents must be loaded from the server each time. An internet connection is required to view documents.

### Why do I see a watermark?

Watermarks are added by document owners to:
- Identify who is viewing the document

Watermarks are a normal part of document security and cannot be removed.

### Is my viewing activity tracked?

Document owners may track:
- When you view a document
- Which pages you view

This helps document owners understand how their content is being used.

### Can I share the document with others?

Sharing depends on the document owner's settings. Some documents can be shared, while others are restricted to specific users.
