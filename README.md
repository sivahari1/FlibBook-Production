## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account (free tier works)
- A Razorpay account (for payments)
- Admin email: sivaramj83@gmail.com

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
```bash
cd flipbook-production
npm install
```

2. **Set up Supabase**:
   - Follow the detailed guide in `SUPABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Create a Supabase project
   - Get your database connection strings
   - Set up storage bucket
   - Configure storage policies

3. **Set up email service (Resend)**:
   - Create a free account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Get your API key from the dashboard
   - Add and verify your domain (or use Resend's test domain for development)
   - Configure DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for production
   - Use support@jstudyroom.dev as the FROM address
   - See detailed setup in the "Email Service Setup" section below

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update all values with your Supabase credentials (see Database Configuration below)
   - Add your Resend API key: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Set from email: `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@jstudyroom.dev`
   - Generate a NextAuth secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Generate a cron secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
   - **Set admin password**: `ADMIN_SEED_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`

## Database Configuration

### Connection Strings

The application uses **two separate database connection strings** for different purposes:

#### 1. DATABASE_URL (Runtime - Session Pooler)
Used by your Next.js application at runtime (API routes, server components).

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_ID:PASSWORD@REGION.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&sslmode=require"
```

**Key points:**
- Uses `pooler.supabase.com` hostname (Session Pooler)
- Includes `pgbouncer=true` for connection pooling
- Includes `connection_limit=1` for serverless environments
- Required for production and local development

#### 2. DIRECT_URL (Prisma CLI Only)
Used **ONLY** by Prisma CLI commands (migrations, db push, db pull, studio).

```bash
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.PROJECT_ID:PASSWORD@db.PROJECT_ID.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require"
```

**Key points:**
- Uses `db.PROJECT_ID.supabase.co` hostname (Direct Connection)
- Does NOT use pgbouncer
- Bypasses the pooler for direct database access
- **NEVER use this in application code!**

### Getting Your Connection Strings

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Database**
4. Find the **Connection string** section
5. Select **Session pooler** mode for DATABASE_URL
6. Select **Direct connection** mode for DIRECT_URL

### Password Encoding

Special characters in passwords **MUST be URL-encoded** in connection strings:

| Character | Encoded |
|-----------|---------|
| !         | %21     |
| @         | %40     |
| #         | %23     |
| $         | %24     |
| %         | %25     |
| ^         | %5E     |
| &         | %26     |
| *         | %2A     |

**Example:**
- Password: `FlipBook2025!`
- Encoded: `FlipBook2025%21`

### Resetting Your Database Password

If you need to reset your database password:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Settings** → **Database**
2. Click **Reset database password**
3. Copy the new password
4. URL-encode any special characters
5. Update both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in your `.env.local` file
6. Update the same variables in Vercel (for production)
7. Redeploy your application

### Testing Database Connection

Run the test script to verify your database configuration:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-db.ts
```

This will:
- Test Prisma client connection
- Run a simple SELECT query
- Verify user count query
- Report any connection issues

### Checking Environment Variables

To verify your environment configuration (with obfuscated passwords):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/log-env.ts
```

This will show:
- DATABASE_URL format and parameters
- DIRECT_URL format and parameters
- Common configuration issues
- Other important environment variables

### Where to Set Environment Variables

#### Local Development
Set in `.env.local` (never commit this file):
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://..."
```

#### Production (Vercel)
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`
4. Set environment to **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
5. Redeploy your application

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Critical Rules:**
- Never use `DIRECT_URL` in application code (API routes, server components)
- Only Prisma CLI should use `DIRECT_URL`
- Always use `DATABASE_URL` for runtime database queries
- The Prisma schema automatically handles URL selection
- Never commit `.env.local` to git
- Always URL-encode special characters in passwords

### Troubleshooting

**Connection timeout errors:**
- Verify your IP is not blocked by Supabase
- Check Supabase status: https://status.supabase.com
- Ensure password is correctly URL-encoded
- Verify you're using the correct hostname (pooler vs direct)

**"Can't reach database server" errors:**
- Check that DATABASE_URL uses `pooler.supabase.com`
- Verify the password is correct
- Ensure `pgbouncer=true` parameter is present
- Try resetting your database password

**Migration errors:**
- Ensure DIRECT_URL uses `db.PROJECT_ID.supabase.co`
- Verify DIRECT_URL does NOT have `pgbouncer=true`
- Check that the password matches in both URLs
   - Add your Razorpay keys

5. **Set up the database**:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

6. **Create admin account**:
```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed-admin.ts
```

7. **Update existing users** (if migrating):
```bash
npx tsx prisma/update-existing-users.ts
```

8. **Run the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

9. **Access the platform**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` - Landing page with access request form
   - Login as admin at `/login` with sivaramj83@gmail.com
   - Access admin dashboard at `/admin`
   - Review and approve access requests
   - Create user accounts with appropriate roles

npm run verify-pdf -- <documentId>
```

**What it checks:**
- Lists all converted page images for a document
- Shows file size for each page (should be > 50 KB)
- Flags suspiciously small pages (< 10 KB) that may be blank
- Provides public URLs for manual inspection

**Example output:**
```
🔍 Verifying PDF conversion for document: abc123

📄 Document: { filename: 'sample.pdf', mimeType: 'application/pdf' }

📊 Found 5 page files:

✅ page-1.jpg: 87.45 KB
   URL: https://...

✅ page-2.jpg: 92.31 KB
   URL: https://...

⚠️  SUSPICIOUS page-3.jpg: 3.45 KB
   URL: https://...

📈 Summary:
   Total pages: 5
   Total size: 356.78 KB
   Average size: 71.36 KB
   Suspicious pages (< 10 KB): 1

⚠️  WARNING: 1 pages are suspiciously small and may be blank!
```

**When to use:**

## Email Service Setup

### Resend Configuration

The application uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for sending transactional emails (verification and password reset).

**Development Setup:**
1. Create a free Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. For testing, you can use Resend's test domain: `onboarding@resend.dev`
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_api_key_here"
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="onboarding@resend.dev"
   ```

**Production Setup:**
1. Add your domain in Resend dashboard
2. Configure DNS records:
   - **SPF**: Add TXT record for email authentication
   - **DKIM**: Add TXT record for email signing
   - **DMARC**: Add TXT record for email policy
3. Verify domain in Resend dashboard
4. Update environment variables:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_production_key"
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="support@jstudyroom.dev"
   ```

**Email Templates:**
- Access request notifications to admin
- User approval emails with login credentials
- Password reset emails from admin
- All emails use branded React Email templates
- Plain text fallbacks included
- Templates located in `/emails` directory

**Rate Limiting:**
- Resend verification: 1 request per 60 seconds
- Password reset: 1 request per 60 seconds
- Prevents abuse and spam

## Automated Maintenance

### Token Cleanup Cron Job

The application includes an automated cron job that cleans up expired verification and password reset tokens:

- **Schedule**: Runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Function**: Deletes tokens expired for more than 7 days
- **Configuration**: Defined in `vercel.json`
- **Security**: Protected by `CRON_SECRET` environment variable

**Setup**:
1. Generate a secure secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Add `CRON_SECRET` to your Vercel environment variables
3. Deploy - Vercel will automatically configure the cron job

For detailed documentation, see `TOKEN_CLEANUP_CRON.md`
