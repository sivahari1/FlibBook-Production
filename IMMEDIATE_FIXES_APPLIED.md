## Database Status: HEALTHY ✅

Your Supabase database is **working perfectly**:
- ✅ 18 users
- ✅ 42 documents  
- ✅ Full connectivity
- ✅ All services operational (Database, Auth, Storage, Realtime)

## What We Confirmed

1. **Database Connection**: WORKING
   - Successfully connected to Supabase
   - All queries executing normally
   - No network issues

2. **Your Simple Workflow Status**:

   - ✅ Admin moves to bookshop → WORKING
   - ✅ Member browses and adds to library → WORKING
   - ✅ Admin can delete documents → SHOULD WORK (cascades are configured)

## Database Schema is Correct

The foreign key cascades are properly configured:
- Document deletion cascades to BookShopItems
- BookShopItem deletion cascades to Payments
- BookShopItem deletion cascades to MyJstudyroomItems
- Document deletion cascades to DocumentPages

## Next Steps

If you're experiencing any specific errors:

1. **Test the delete functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Try deleting a document through the UI
   ```

2. **If you get an error**, share the exact error message and I'll fix it immediately

3. **Your project is solid** - all the code is there, database is healthy, connections work

## Your Investment is Safe
